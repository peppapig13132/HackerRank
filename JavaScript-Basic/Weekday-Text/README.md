# JavaScript: Weekday Text
Implement the function _weekdayText_ such that:
- It takes a single argument, _weekdays_, which is an array of strings.
- It returns a new function that called _getText_ that takes a single integer argument, number, and does the following.
  - It returns the value from the _weekdays_ array at that 0-based index _number_.
  - If _number_ is out of range, the function throws an Error object with the message of 'Invalid weekday number'.

```
function weekdayText(weekdays) {
  // Implement your code here
}
```
